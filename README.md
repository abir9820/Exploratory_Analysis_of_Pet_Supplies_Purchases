# Pet Supplies Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an exploratory analysis of a pet supplies dataset using Anaconda and Python. The dataset, "pet_supplies_2212.csv," contains information on various pet products, including details, sales data, and repeat purchase information. The primary objectives are:

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

- **Validation:** Check for missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant entries to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, remove irrelevant data, and ensure consistency and accuracy. Save changes to "updated_pet_supplies.csv" for further analysis.

### Analysis Goals

- Calculate product counts for repeated and non-repeated purchases.
- Visualize these comparisons using a bar chart.
- Analyze sales distribution across different products with a histogram.
- Investigate the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior using box plots.

## Tools and Technologies

This project leverages the following tools and technologies:

- Anaconda distribution of Python
- Python programming language
- Pandas Library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib library for data visualization

## Project Workflow

1. Load the "pet_supplies_2212.csv" dataset using Pandas.
2. Validate the dataset by checking for missing values and inconsistencies.
3. Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant data, saving changes to "updated_pet_supplies.csv."
4. Compare products with repeat purchases and those without, visualizing results with a bar chart.
5. Analyze the sales distribution through a histogram.
6. Investigate the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior using box plots.
7. Document insights and findings from each analysis step.
8. Organize code and analysis within a Jupyter Notebook.
9. Upload the project to GitHub upon completion.

## Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive exploratory analysis of the pet supplies dataset.
- Insights into repurchase trends, sales distribution, and the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior.
- Thorough documentation of the project, including analysis steps and findings.
- Organized project code and analysis within a Jupyter Notebook.
- The project is available on GitHub for others to learn from and use.
