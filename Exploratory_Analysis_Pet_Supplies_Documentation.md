# Exploratory Analysis of Pet Supplies Purchases

## Project Objective
My objective for this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of a pet supplies dataset using Anaconda and Python. The dataset, "pet_supplies_2212.csv," contains information about various pet products, including details, sales data, and repeat purchase information. My main goals are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**

   - **Validation:** We assess the dataset to identify missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant entries. This helps us ensure the integrity of the data before proceeding with analysis.
   - **Data Cleaning:** After identifying issues, we perform data cleaning procedures. This includes imputing missing values using appropriate methods and removing irrelevant data points that don't contribute to the analysis.
   - **Consistency and Accuracy:** We also adjust data values if required to ensure consistency and accuracy. This step is crucial to prevent misleading insights resulting from incorrect or inconsistent data.

2. **Analysis of Repeat Purchases:**

   - Calculate the number of products in each category for repeated and non-repeated purchases.
   - Create a bar chart to visually represent the comparison results and identify trends.

3. **Sales Distribution Visualization:**

   - Generate a histogram analysis of the sales data to understand the distribution of sales across different products.

4. **Sales and Repeat Purchase Relationship Analysis:**

   - Investigate the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior using box plots.
   - Create separate box plots for products with repeat purchases and those without to visualize variations in sales.

## Tools and Technologies
- Anaconda distribution of Python
- Python programming language
- Pandas Library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib library for data visualization

## Project Steps
1. Load the "pet_supplies_2212.csv" dataset using Pandas.
2. Conduct data validation by checking for missing values and inconsistencies.
3. Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant data.
4. Compare products with repeat purchases and those without.
5. Create a bar chart to visualize the comparison results.
6. Generate a histogram analysis to understand sales distribution.
7. Use box plots to analyze the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior.
8. Document insights and findings from each analysis step.
9. Organize code and analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.
10. Upload the project to GitHub once completed.

## Expected Outcome
- Completion of a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the pet supplies dataset.
- Insights gained into repurchase trends, sales distribution, and the relationship between sales and repeat purchase behavior.
- Thorough documentation of the project, including analysis steps and findings.
- Project code and analysis will be organized within a Jupyter Notebook.
- The project will be uploaded and shared on GitHub, allowing others to learn from the analysis and code.
